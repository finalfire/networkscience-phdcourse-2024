\begin{abstract}
This is a brief summary of the report. The abstract should provide an overview of the study, including the main findings and conclusions.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
In this section, provide an introduction to the study. Describe the complex system or graph problem you are analyzing or extending. Explain the study's significance and outline your work's main objectives and contributions.

Recall that you can actually select one of two following themes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item to conduct an empirical analysis of a complex system by employing one of the discussed models;
    \item to study an extension of a classical problem on graphs (such as influence maximization, community detection, etc) in one of the discussed models.
\end{itemize}

Also, remember that \textbf{it is not necessary to create a complete research paper!} The report should highlight your idea and the proposed approach. It is not necessary to present novel results or contexts.

\section{Overview of Related Literature}
Review the existing literature related to your study. Discuss previous work on similar complex systems or graph problems. Highlight how your study fits into the existing body of knowledge and identify any gaps or areas that your study could addresses.

\section{Methodology}
Describe the methodology you used in your study. Include detailed explanations of the models, algorithms, or analytical techniques employed. If you are extending a classical problem, explain the modifications or extensions made to the existing methods.

\section{Discussion of Analyses / Experiments}
Present the results of your analyses or experiments. Use appropriate figures, tables, and graphs to illustrate your findings. Discuss the implications of the results and compare them with the findings of related studies. If applicable, explain any limitations or challenges encountered during the study.

\section{Conclusion}
Summarize the main findings of your study. Discuss the broader implications of your work and suggest possible directions for future research. Highlight the contributions of your study to the field of network science.
