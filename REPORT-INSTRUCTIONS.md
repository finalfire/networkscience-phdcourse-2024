# How to Prepare the Report

The final project (hereafter, report) consists of a practical study of the models and concepts encountered during the course.

**The final project can be carried out in team of 4 people maximum.**

To carry out the report, first select the kind of study you prefer to follow. There are two possible categories:

* Conduct an empirical analysis of a complex system by employing one of the discussed models;
* Study an extension of a classical problem on graphs (such as influence maximization, community detection, etc.) in one of the discussed models.

After deciding your preference, start asking yourself what you need to carry out the report. Common requirements are:

* The problem I want to address (e.g., I want to tackle the influence maximization problem on hypernetworks) or the context I want to study (e.g., I want to analyze the centrality values of users in a social network);
* A dataset to study or to carry out experiments on (you can find some useful links on `slides/x-handle-graph-data.pdf`)
* How do I implement my approach and what measures do I use? (e.g., I implement the code and conduct the analysis in Python; e.g., I decide to analyze properties such as the number of components, the number of interactions, concepts such as degree, density, etc.)

**It is not necessary for the report to be a complete research paper!** Try to take inspiration from classical works on the matter. Suggested references are given at the end of this document.

As for the template, use the `template/main.tex` file. You can also choose to write it using another word processor.

Feel free to contact me for support, for asking me questions or anything else.

**Deadline: June 30th, 2024 (23:59 AoE).**  
You can send the report (as a .pdf file) to fcauteruccio@unisa.it.  
The certificate of attendance and completion of the course will be issued as soon as you send the report. If you need it earlier (e.g., for a bureaucratic process), please contact me via email.
